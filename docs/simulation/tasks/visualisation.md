# üîç Visualisation and Teleop

* Table of contents
{:toc}

The goal of this section is to run the robot simulation using Gazebo, visualise the SMB robot in RViz, control the robot.

First of all, make sure the `smb_gazebo` has been already built successfully.

```bash
# In the host pc, build the smb_gazebo package if you haven't already
 smb_build_packages_up_to meta_smb_sim
```

## üëÄ Visualisation

Run the following commands in the host pc to visualise the robot.

```bash
# In the host pc
ros2 launch smb_gazebo gazebo.launch.py
```

To run the simulation you do not need a connection to SMB.

{: .important } 
Wait until gazebo launches.


To run the state estimation and mapping use the following command.

```bash
ros2 launch smb_bringup smb_sim_se.launch.py
```
## üéÆ Teleoperation

You can drive the robot with the keyboard. If you want to drive the robot, make sure that the terminal where you launched the simulation (i.e. where the [`teleop_twist_keyboard`](http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_keyboard) node is running) is selected while pressing the keys. To use the keyboard run the following alias:

    ```bash
    # In the host pc
    smb_teleop_twist_keyboard
    ```

    - Use the following keys to move:

        | u | i | o |
        | j | k | l |
        | m | , | . |

    - Use the following keys to control speed:

        - `q/z`: Increase/decrease max speeds by 10%
        - `w/x`: Increase/decrease only linear speed by 10%
        - `e/c`: Increase/decrease only angular speed by 10%

    - Use any other key to stop.

    Please refer to the [package documentation](http://wiki.ros.org/teleop_twist_keyboard#Controls) for more info.

# üîç Navigation
The goal of this section is to run the robot simulation using Gazebo, visualise the SMB robot in RViz, putting waypoints and goalpoints to demonstrate the autonomous capabilities of the robot.

```bash
# In the host pc
ros2 launch smb_bringup smb_sim_navigation.launch.py 
```

# üîç Exploration

In this section we will see a fully autonomous robot exploring the environment working with far planner and ground truth.ü•≥

```bash
# In the host pc
ros2 launch smb_bringup smb_sim_exploration.launch.py
```
